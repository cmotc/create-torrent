                <p>
                This tool helps you generate web-seeded torrents with ease, thanks to
                <a href="https://github.com/feross/create-torrent">feross/create-torrent</a>
                and
                <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">substack/node-browserify</a>.</br>
                It's basically a static web site(actually it's definitely a static
                web site) that loads the create-torrent library used by the
                wonderful <a href="https://github.com/feross/webtorrent">feross/webtorrent</a> <a href="https://webtorrent.io">application</a>
                and gives you a simple way to use it to create a torrent for a
                file which is already on the web(by using web seeding). It is
                not intended for creating torrents without web seeds and it
                probably won't work if you try and give it a file stored locally
                on your computer. Instead, it's intended to provide an easy way
                to make files already hosted as HTTP/S downloads torrent-ready.
                If you need to make a torrent without a web seed, I reccommend
                you use the tools provided by your torrent client or the
                excellent mktorrent program available for Unix-Like systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                Why did I create this? Because sites like megaupload and whatnot
                are annoying as hell, but the things that make them annoying are
                also things they have a point about(Speed limits for free users,
                file size limits that basically preclude uploading ISO's and
                Android ROM's as easy to use single files, reverse Turing Tests,
                and the ever-present 45 second delay). It's reasonable for them
                to calculate what they can provide as a business. It's also
                reasonable for technologies like Bittorrent to provide a much,
                much, much better option. In order to help transition more
                people off of these types of sites and onto bittorrent, this
                application uses web sources to bootstrap peer-to-peer
                downloads. And frankly, with the library already created by the
                wonderful <a href="https://github.com/feross">@feross</a> it was
                way to easy not to.
                </p>
                <h4>Why is Bittorrent Better than "Normal" web downloads?</h4>
                <p>
                Well first, forget thinking about the Web as normal. The web is
                a somewhat cool way of delivering easily consumable hypertext
                content across the internet, a much, much larger and much much
                more versatile system. Web downloads come from one location run
                by one company, that has to pay for the hosting, development
                costs, bandwidth, and other overhead, and that normally have the
                power to change the contents of their servers or how they serve
                downloads. I don't think this is a remotely healthy situation,
                especially when people expect downloads to be more-or-less free.
                Instead of accommodating all these shortcomings, Bittorrent
                thinks about how to get people what they need in a more reliable
                and versatile way. Bittorrent downloads can be downloaded in
                easily-resumable chunks, with each peer only serving a few
                chunks of the file to the downloader. It also has built in
                hashing, so you know the file that you end up with is the one
                you intended to download. In healthy torrents, downloads are
                faster and, as this web site can more-or-less demonstrate, you
                can turn a regular web download into a torrent and use that web
                download as a source for the torrent's contents.

                <h4>Caveats/What sites can I use to Bootstrap my own Torrents?</h4>
                Unfortunately, it's probably impossible in the long term to use
                this app with sites that generate a random download URL on a
                per-download basis, especially after requiring a waiting period.
                Which kind of sucks. But not all HTTP/S file sharing options are
                precluded. Some tenative recommendations for bootstrapping your
                torrents are: </br>
                <a href="https://openmailbox.org/">Openmailbox.org gives you a 2GB OwnCloud instance running on a Fully-Free Software Stack.</a> </br>
                <a href="https://github.com/">Github Releases can be of any size and any type and have static, no-delay URL's for downloading.</a> </br>
                <a href="https://github.com/">Github Pages can host files of up to 100MB and by nature have static URL's</a> </br>
                <a href="https://google.com/">It is possible to extract static URL's for files on Google Drive</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/">using this procedure</a> </br>
                <a href="https://dropbox.com/">And it's also possible to </a> <a href="https://ryanmo.co/2013/11/03/dropboxsharedlinks/"> extract static URL's for files hosted on Dropbox</a> </br>
                A word on "recommendations," of these services, only
                Openmailbox.org is built only using Free Software. But, this
                software is expressly designed to liberate the users by
                gradually transitioning them away from non-free services to
                reasonable peer-to-peer downloading options that can be used
                with no proprietary software. It is, in fact, expressly intended
                to minimize how much these sites need to be used. So use it with
                Openmailbox.org to save them money and allow them to keep
                providing their excellent, freedom-respecting e-mail services.
                Use it with the other sites to get away from using them anymore
                as efficiently as possible.

        <div id="disclaimer">
                All of the functionality of this site is provided with a single
                library and a single javascript function. I, and the rest of the
                thinking people of the world, want you to look at that code and
                make sure it does what it says it will do. Your privacy, in the
                absolutest sense, is important to me. So snce you're here, you
                don't send any more requests to any server anywhere(With this
                application), except when it looks at the Web Seed URL's.
                I don't make any attempt to log any information about anyone who
                comes here, because invading your privacy and limiting your
                access to information, will always lead to endangering your
                safety, no matter who does it or how much they think they know.
                That said, it doesn't mean much because I have no control over
                the supporting services whatsoever. But if you are being tracked
                for creating torrents with this tool, then it was against my
                express wishes and intentions(so use Tor.).If you wish to avoid
                this(Admittely low right now) risk, you can run this application
                locally with very little effort. Simply clone the repository and
                copy the files index.html, ct.js, and style.css into a
                locally-hosted http server and visit that site instead. Even if
                it never becomes necessary, it's very important to preserve
                privately held, local applications as well as making networking
                technologies more accessible.
